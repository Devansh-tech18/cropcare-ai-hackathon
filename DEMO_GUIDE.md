#### **Quick Demo Commands:**
```javascript
// Open browser console (F12) and run:
showDemoResults('blight')    // Shows leaf blight disease
showDemoResults('mildew')    // Shows powdery mildew
showDemoResults('healthy')   // Shows healthy crop
showDemoResults()           // Shows random disease
```
